# Reddit-Image-Downloading-Bot
Downloads top images of the week from any subreddit

## HOW TO USE:

There are 4 files necessary:

-The Main Python Script

-A Directory text file

-A Client Information text file

-A Subreddit text file

##### **The Main Python Script:**

For this one, all you have to do is download it. There are no modifications necessary for it to function

##### **Directory Text File:**

This should be a text file called "Directory.txt" and should be saved in the same location as the python script. The contents of this file should be the directory that you want the images from reddit saved to. For example, it should be something like "C:\Users\JohnDoe\Documents"

Note that the document should **only** have that text and nothing more. No spaces, no linebreaks, nothing else.

##### **Client Information Text File:**

This should be a text file called "ClientInfo.txt" and should also be saved in the same location as the python script.
